    Review the context you get along with the current user calendar:

    {calendar}

    You should:

    (1) For each row in the current calendar, if the feedback of that event is "[Empty]" and the context contains
    information about the user's feedback to that event, replace the "[Empty]" in that row with a concise description
    of the feedback.

    (2) For the upcoming event that appears in the context, create a new row in the calendar to describe that event.
    You should fill in the "Feedback" part of that new row with "[Empty]".

    Do not remove any rows from the current calendar.
  expected_output: >
    An updated version of user's calendar, where:

    the first row should simply be "The User's Calendar:",

    and each row from the second should consist of (1) "Time: {Time of the event}", (2) "Schedule: {A brief description of the
    event}", and (3) "Feedback: {User's feedback, or [Empty]}".
